# Nvim.Config2

## Intensions For Rewrite

My intentions for this rewrite is to cut out a lot of the Lazy.nvim and Kickstart related configuration. I may opt to ultimately return to the same feature set, but I am hoping that by adding this manually myself, I learn to understand how it works better. 

## Design Goals

Design Goals as follows:

- Use Native Neovim functionality as much as possible, lsp config, vim.pack etc
- Use Mini functionality as much as possible
- From an Aesthetic point of view, I quite like NvChad so will tend in that direction

## Setup

Installation Steps
First, install nvim and all related dependancies. Suggest just using the install recipes in kickstart.nvim
Second, clone this repository into config files section.
This could be in several places:

- In Windows it is: `git clone https://github.com/EdgarAllenExile/nvim.config $HOME/AppData/Local/nvim`
- In Linux / MacOS use: `git clone https://github.com/EdgarAllenExile/nvim.config "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim`
